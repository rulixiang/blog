在读一个开源代码的时候发现了一个奇妙的东西，代码链接如下[https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa/blob/master/train_cls.py#L142](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa/blob/master/train_cls.py#L142)。把其中不重要的部分忽略掉,可以得到如下代码。

``` python
for ep in range(args.max_epoches):
    for iter, pack in enumerate(train_data_loader):
        ## something
    else:
        ## something
## something
```
可以看到，这里的``` else ```和``` for ```是成对的，而不是和一般常用的``` if ```成对出现。那么这样写会有什么效果呢？我尝试搜了一下,发现了这个解释[http://simeonvisser.com/posts/using-else-in-python.html](http://simeonvisser.com/posts/using-else-in-python.html)。


>This is where things become interesting as the else statement can lead to cleaner code. It frequently happens that we wish to iterate over a collection of objects and when a certain condition is met we break from the loop. For example:
>``` python
>for car in cars:
>    if needs_repair(car):
>        send_for_repair(car)
>        break
>```
> In this example we iterate over a collection of cars and we stop when we've found a car that needs a repair. No further cars will be > examined when the first broken car has been found.
> 
> Now, what if we wish to take a certain action when we haven't found any car for repair? We could introduce a variable car_found_for_repair for this purpose:
> ``` python
> car_found_for_repair = False
> for car in cars:
>    if needs_repair(car):
>        send_for_repair(car)
>        car_found_for_repair = True
>        break
>if not car_found_for_repair:
>    # do something
>    ...
>```
> Python allows an elegant solution by adding an else statement to the for loop. The block of code after the else is executed when we have not performed a break in the loop. The code now looks as follows and it behaves the same:
>``` python
>for car in cars:
>    if needs_repair(car):
>        send_for_repair(car)
>        break
>else:
>    # do something
>    ...
>```
> In other words, when the for loop completes successfully (i.e., without being exited by a break statement) the else section is executed. But when we break from the loop at some point then that section won't be executed.

也就是说。``` for + else```写法实现的功能是当``` for ```循环里面出现```break```的时候，跳出之后也会自动跳过``` else ```里面的句子；同样的功能使用``` if + flag ```的方法实现就很不优雅，例如quote里面第2和第3个代码块的区别。
